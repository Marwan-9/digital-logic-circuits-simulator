## Overview 
This application allows user to design and simulate digital circuits; to see its output and behaviour. Simulator provides a graphical user interface (GUI) with tools for drawing circuit diagrams, simulating logic functions, and analyzing the behavior of the circuit. This was the project of the first programming course in Cairo University, Computer Engineering Department.


## How to Run Using Visual Studio 

 1. Downlaod all files on your local machine.
 2. Open "Project Code Framework" folder.
 3. Open "graphics_prj.sln" file, using Visual Studio.
 4. Run the code (F5).

 ## How to Run Using gcc
 &emsp; &ensp; Makefile will be added soon.

## User Manual 
 ### 1. Add Component:
 1. From the toolbar click on the component you want to add.

### 2. Delete Component:

 1. From the toolbar click on "Delete".
 2. Click on the component you want to delete.

 ### 3. Copy/Cut Component:
 1. From the toolbar click on "Copy"/"Cut".
 2. Click on the component you want to "Copy"/"Cut".
 3. From the toolbar click on "Paste".
 4.  Click on the schema, wherever you want to paste the component.

### 4. Rename Component:
1. From the toolbar click on "Label".
2. Click on the component you want to rename.
3. Write the new name, then press "Enter".

### 5. Connect Components:
1. From the toolbar click on "Wire".
2. Click on the first end the the wire will be connected to.
3. Click on the second end the the wire will be connected to.
4. Wire will appear between the two ends.

### 6. Simulate the Ciruiut:
1. Build your digital ciruit.

3. To change the switch state (on/off), click on "Switch" from the toolbar then click on the switch.
4. To return to the Design Mode, click on "Design" from the toolbar.

### 7. Save the Ciruit:
1. From the toolbar click on "Save".
2. Enter the file name to be saved, then press Enter.

### 8. Load a Ciruit:
1. From the toolbar click on "Load".
2. Enter the file name to be loaded, then press Enter.
**Make sure that the file is loacted inside "SavedFiles" directory.**

## Issues
1. XOR gate is functioning like NOR gate.
2. When switching to Simulate Mode, you should change the state of any switch to start the simulation. i.e simualtion does not start untill you change one of the switchs states.
3. Deleting a wire is a little bit challenging.
4. Truth Table and Probing is not implemtend.
